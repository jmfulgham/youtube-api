YouTube API 

I was so excited to create this mini project. Initially I finished this without using the Bootstrap framework to practice using a Google API. Then, after doing some research around the web, I saw that Bootstrap was a tool a lot of companies used. I took this oppportunity to get acquainted with the framework.

This small app is just a simpler version of YouTube; you have the ability to search YouTube without all the extra noise.
